Description: Env-switcher package
 The env-switcher package provides an convenient method for users to
 switch between "similar" packages.  System- and user-level defaults
 are maintained in data files and are examined at shell invocation time
 to determine how the user's enviornment should be set up.
 .
 The canonical example of where this is helpful is using multiple
 implementations of the Message Passing Interface (MPI).  This
 typically requires that the user's "dot" files are set appropriately
 on each machine that is used since rsh/ssh are typically used to
 invoke commands on remote nodes.
 .
 The env-switcher package alleviates the need for users to manually
 edit their fot files, and instead gives the user commandline control
 to switch between multiple implementations of MPI.
 .
 While this package was specifically motivated by the use of multiple
 MPI implementations on OSCAR clusters, there is nothing specific to
 either OSCAR or MPI in env-switcher -- switching between mulitple MPI
 implementations is only used in this description as an example.  As
 such, it can be used in any environment for any "switching" kind of
 purpose.
